    <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            I am an enthusiastic, inquisitive and friendly person. I grew up in Ireland and went to Uni in Dublin. 
            I studied Optometry and soon after qualifying I move to London to work as an optometrist. 
            During my optometry career I have worked in full time jobs and most recently as freelance doing locum work for the past 4 years. 
            I have made London my home and love the sense of community I feel here now that I will recognise people and bump into people I know on the street and as I go about my life.
        </p>

    <h2>Why I would want to move into a career as a developer</h2>
        <p>
            These are the reasons
        </p>
    <h2>This is what I have learnt so far in my application</h2>
        <p>
            I have learned a lot during the application process. I have enjoyed the coding meet ups and learning coding using numerous resorces. 
            I found javascript the most challening to learn by far.

        For the hobby page I had a lot to learn as I had never made a website before. It was daunting to learn how everything so and I didn't know where to start. I started by trying to learn from the 
        rescorces in the FAC project page. I worked on FreeCodeCamp and from this I learnt a lot of the basics. I built as much as I could and then would have to look things up as I wanted and needed to do them.

    <h2>Application Gallery Page Project</h2>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Read more</button>
    <p class="content">
        For the gallery I had to start learning more about CSS and how to use flexbox to make a webpage. This involved a lot of 
        tutoirials and looking things up. There were many different chalenges I needed to master also. I needed to display the 
        websites in a gallery format. There were other features that were needed, I needed a button that would expand the descrition 
        and for the gallery to rote into a column view for smaller screens.
