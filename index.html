    <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            I am an enthusiastic, inquisitive and friendly person. I grew up in Ireland and went to Uni in Dublin. 
            I studied Optometry and soon after qualifying I move to London to work as an optometrist. 
            During my optometry career I have worked in full time jobs and most recently as freelance doing locum work for the past 4 years. 
            I have made London my home and love the sense of community I feel here now that I will recognise people and bump into people I know on the street and as I go about my life.

    <h2>Why I would want to move into a career as a developer</h2>
        <p>
            I would love to work in technology and be a developer as I am excited for a career change.
            It appears there is always more to learn as a developer and I would relish that oppurtinuity to be curious and keep learning throughtout my career.
            I want the oppurtunitys being a developer would provide
            I want to work in a broad career that gives seemingly unlimited oppurtunity, emerging technology is ever evolving and with recent developments with AI I would love to be involved and see this develop.

    <h2>This is what I have learnt so far in my application</h2>
        <p>
            I have learned a lot during the application process. I have enjoyed the coding meet ups and learning coding using numerous resorces. 
            I found javascript the most challening to learn by far.
