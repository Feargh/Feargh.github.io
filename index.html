            <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am an enthusiastic, inquisitive and friendly person. I grew up in Ireland and went to Uni in Dublin. 
                    I studied Optometry and soon after qualifying I move to London to work as an optometrist. 
                    During my optometry career I have worked in full time jobs and most recently as freelance doing locum work since 2018.
                    I have made London my home and love the sense of community I feel here now that I will recognise people and bump into people I know on the street and as I go about my life.

                <p>
                    I would love to work in technology and be a developer as I am excited for a career change.
                    It appears there is always more to learn as a developer and I would relish that oppurtinuity to be curious and keep learning throughtout my career.
                    I want the oppurtunitys being a developer would provide
                    I want to work in a broad career that gives seemingly unlimited oppurtunity, emerging technology is ever evolving and with recent developments with AI I would love to be involved and see this develop.

            <h2>This is what I have learnt so far in my application</h2>
                <p>
                    I have learned a lot during the application process. I have enjoyed the coding meet ups and learning coding using numerous resorces. I have learnt using freeCodeCamp, W3School, googling, following different tutorials on youtube.
                    I found javascript the most challening to learn by far.
