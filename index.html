            <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am an enthusiastic, inquisitive, friendly, resourceful and like to learn from and solve problems that I encounter.
                    Originally from Ireland, I pursued a career in optometry after completing my degree in Dublin. 
                    Following my qualification, I travelled in Asia, which ignited my passion for exploration and new experiences. 
                    I then settled in London, where I have been working as an optometrist since.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout my optometry career, I have gained valuable experience through both full-time positions and freelance work. 
                    Since 2018, I have been engaged in locum work, providing me with opportunities to contribute my skills and knowledge to various companies. 
                    London has become my home, and I relish the strong sense of community I have developed here. 
                    It's incredibly fulfilling to recognize familiar faces and encounter acquaintances while going about my daily life.

                </p>
                <p>
                    In my free time I enjoy exercising currently I run and wild swim in the summer. 
                    I have continued to enjoy travelling most recently in Portugal and late last year I travelled to Bali and Singapore. 
                    I enjoy learning more about technology and like to buy second hand technology mostly so I can see how it works. 
                    I enjoy learning and have recently started in person Portuguese classes.

            <h2>Why I would want to be a developer</h2>
                <p>
                    My interest in technology has been lifelong. 
                    I had my first interaction with technology when my father brought home a windows 95 computer. 
                    I enthusiastically used this even though I had not learned to read yet. 
                    As a teenager I was always keen to make my games run better, which lead to googling ways to make the OS run faster and try and implement these. 
                    I then graduated to taking computers and laptops apart to try and clean the parts or upgrade components.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am deeply drawn to the world of technology and have a strong desire to transition into a career as a developer. 
                    The prospect of a career change fills me with excitement and anticipation. 
                    As a developer, I believe there is always something new to learn and explore, providing me with endless opportunities to satisfy my curiosity and expand my knowledge throughout my professional journey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am particularly fascinated by the rapidly evolving nature of the technology industry. 
                    The emergence of new technologies and the advancements in areas such as artificial intelligence are incredibly intriguing to me. 
                    I know about physical hardware and would like to learn about the software and be a developer.
                    I am eager to be a part of this ever-evolving landscape and witness first-hand the development and impact of such innovations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Working as a developer offers seemingly unlimited possibilities for growth and personal development. 
                    I am eager to embrace the challenges and rewards that come with being at the forefront of technological advancements. 
                    By becoming a developer, I can contribute to shaping the future of technology while continuously expanding my skills, expertise and fulfil a life term dream of working with computers.

            <h2>What I have learnt so far</h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout the application process, I have embarked on a learning journey. 
                    I have thoroughly enjoyed attending coding meetups and utilizing various resources to develop my coding skills. 
                    Prior to attending these meetups in early 2023, I had no prior coding experience. 
                    However, I am proud to say that I would say I have made significant progress in a relatively short period of time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To enhance my learning, I have actively engaged with platforms such as freeCodeCamp and W3Schools. 
                    Additionally, I have utilized the power of online research, often relying on Google searches to find answers and solutions. 
                    I have also found valuable guidance by following different coding tutorials on YouTube. 
                    More recently I have also begun leveraging ChatGPT as a coaching tool, further enriching my learning experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While all aspects of coding have presented their own challenges, I have found JavaScript to be particularly demanding. 
                    However, I have persevered and embraced the difficulties as opportunities for growth. 
                    Overcoming these challenges has not only expanded my knowledge but also reinforced my determination to pursue a career in coding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I initally wanted to apply for the cohort deadline of March 2023. 
                    But as I had only started to learn to code in January I delayed my application to the July deadline.
                    I really took the oppurnity to learn more about coding in this time.
                    I did the first 4 weeks of CS50 which I enjoyed imensly.
                    I learned a lot about computer science concets and the C language.
                    When I came back to learning javascript it was very nice how many features are built into javascript compared to C.

                    Memory Game Project
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially I didn't know what game to make for my application, so I decided to learn about how to code games in general.
                    I followed many tutorials to make games including breakout, rock paper scissors and tetris.
                    When I saw a memory game, I knew this was what I wanted to make.
                    My 5-year-old nephew has been obsessed with memory games and I wanted to build a game that he could play and to put his picture in the game as a surprise was something I knew I had to do!
