            <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am an enthusiastic, inquisitive, and friendly individual. 
                    Originally from Ireland, I pursued a career in optometry after completing my degree in Dublin. 
                    Following my qualification, I embarked on a journey throughout South East Asia, which fuelled my passion for exploration and new experiences. 
                    I then settled in London, where I have been working as an optometrist since.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout my optometry career, I have gained valuable experience through both full-time positions and freelance work. 
                    Since 2018, I have been engaged in locum work, providing me with opportunities to contribute my skills and knowledge to various companies. 
                    London has become my home, and I relish the strong sense of community I have developed here. 
                    It's incredibly fulfilling to recognize familiar faces and encounter acquaintances while going about my daily life.

                    I am particularly fascinated by the rapidly evolving nature of the technology industry. 
                    The emergence of new technologies and the advancements in areas such as artificial intelligence are incredibly intriguing to me. 
                    I am eager to be a part of this ever-evolving landscape and witness first-hand the development and impact of such innovations.

            <h2>This is what I have learnt so far in my application</h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout the application process, I have embarked on a learning journey. 
                    I have thoroughly enjoyed attending coding meetups and utilizing various resources to develop my coding skills. 
                    Prior to attending these meetups in early 2023, I had no prior coding experience. 
                    However, I am proud to say that I would say I have made significant progress in a relatively short period of time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To enhance my learning, I have actively engaged with platforms such as freeCodeCamp and W3Schools. 
                    Additionally, I have utilized the power of online research, often relying on Google searches to find answers and solutions. 
                    I have also found valuable guidance by following different coding tutorials on YouTube. 
                    More recently I have also begun leveraging ChatGPT as a coaching tool, further enriching my learning experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While all aspects of coding have presented their own challenges, I have found JavaScript to be particularly demanding. 
                    However, I have persevered and embraced the difficulties as opportunities for growth. 
                    Overcoming these challenges has not only expanded my knowledge but also reinforced my determination to pursue a career in coding.
